## Prerequisites

- An [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
- Build Administrators must be given "Contribute to pull requests" access. Check [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57985733) for guidance on setting up permissions.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the PRIA DevOps Extension**

   Install the [PRIA](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EricWellnitz.pria) DevOps extension from the Azure DevOps Marketplace.

2. **Create a PRIA Code Review Pipeline**

   Create an [Azure DevOps Pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline) using the following YAML snippet to set up the PRIA code review task:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     branches:
       exclude:
         - '*'

   pr:
     branches:
       include:
         - '*'

   jobs:
     - job: CodeReview
       pool:
         vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
       steps:
         - checkout: self
           persistCredentials: true
         - task: PRIAAZURE@2
           inputs:
             api_endpoint: $(OpenAI_Endpoint)
             api_version: $(OpenAI_Version)
             api_key: $(OpenAI_ApiKey)
2. **Configure your Main Branch for Build Validation**

	Cofigure Azure DevOps [Build Validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser#build-validation) to use PRIA Code Review Pipeline created above  as a build validation pipeline.

## Build & Publish

1. Install [Prequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-build-task?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Fmarketplace-extensibility%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-devops#prerequisites)
2. Run `npm install -g typescript` to install TypeScript
3. Run `tsc.cmd` from `.\pr-inspection-assistant\src\` to build the solution
4. Run `tfx extension create --manifest-globs vss-extension.json` from `.\pr-inspection-assistant\` to package the solution
